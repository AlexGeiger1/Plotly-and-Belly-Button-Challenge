# Plotly-and-Belly-Button-Challenge

The purpose of the project was to create a web page displayine results from a sample of people who participated in a study.  First, the ID number of the study participant must be selected from the drop-down. Their demographic information is then displayed along with 3 charts.  The gauge displays how many time they washed their navas. The horizontal bar chart indicates the top 10 bacteria found in their cultures and finally a bubble chart shows the volume.  Hover over the bubbles to see the bacteria names involved for the selected ID.
